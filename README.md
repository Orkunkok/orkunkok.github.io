## About Me
I am a senior student in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Bilkent University. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I’ve found that I am most at home working directly with hardware. While I am capable in C and assembly, my real interest lies in the physical side of engineering—building circuits, interfacing sensors, and seeing code interact with real-world components. This site documents the hardware projects and embedded systems I’ve developed during my time at Bilkent.
