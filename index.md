## About Me

I am a senior student in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Bilkent University.  
Throughout my undergraduate studies, I’ve found that I am most at home working directly with hardware.

While I am capable in C and assembly, my real interest lies in the physical side of engineering—building circuits, interfacing sensors, and seeing code interact with real-world components.

This site documents the hardware projects and embedded systems I’ve developed during my time at Bilkent.
